    <h1>White Sandwich Bread</h1>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>2 1/2 Cups All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>2 Teaspoons Yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons Salt</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup milk, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 Cup Water, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Honey</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Instructions</h2>
        <li>Whisk flour, salt, and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk milk, water, melted butter, and honey in a large measuring cup until the honey is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Using the dough hook on the standing mixer, slowly add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and mix on low speed until dough forms. Scrape the bowl down as needed. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and elastic, 8-10 mintes. Add more flour or water in small increments as necessary so the dough clears the sides of the bowl and just sticks to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a smooth ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise 1 1/2 - 2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Lightly grease a loaf pan. Press down on the dough to deflate and place it on a floured surface. Press and stretch the dough into an 8"x6" rectangle.  Roll the dough into a firm cylinder, pinch the seam closed, and place it seam side down into the prepared loaf pan. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise another 1 - 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Remove the plastic wrap and mist the loaf with water. Bake 35-40 minutes until loaf is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let loaf cool in pan for 15 minutes, then remove from pan and cool on wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
